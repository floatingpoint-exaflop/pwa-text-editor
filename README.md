  ## Description
  This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Nineteen of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice configuring a progressive web application, primarily on the client side. The deployed JATE app can be installed locally, so you can use it at home on your machine to type and edit plaintext! I found this simple tool so compelling because we use PWAs constantly in modern daily life, and I even recently had installed Snapchat's local client, so it was awesome to get a sense of how that stuff works.

  ## Installation
  To install this project after copying down the repo, you will first need to run npm install (-y for default settings) on the project root, which should grant you access to the necessary soft; Use of other/newer versions of inquirer are not recommended for this project unless I can figure out how to update the inquirer syntax in the actual js code.

  ## Usage
  1. To use this project, ensure you have the node packages installed as specified in the Installation section above.
  2. Open a terminal on the db folder and run npm start-dev.
  3. Feel free to download and play around with JATE! It's that simple!

  ## Contributing
  If you want to contribute to this project - particularly if you know how I might leverage the client/server code so it works as a boilerplate to build out more interesting PWA apps, see my contact info in the Questions section below. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out! I am a beginner at this stuff but always hungry to learn from others in the community.

  ## Tests
  This app is best tested using npm start-dev on localhost:3000, but you can also just test it by using the deployed version on Render :)
